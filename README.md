# MyReads Project

MyReads is an application made with React to manage books and archive them. I can search for new books and choose if I want to read, I'm reading or I've read.

*This project was based at the [starter template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.*

## Project Setup

1. Clone the Project - `git clone https://github.com/estevanbc/reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd reactnd-project-myreads-starter`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Start the app - `npm start`
